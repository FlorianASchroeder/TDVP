# Tree-Tensor-Network States for Bosons
This repository contains a Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) implementation based on Matrix Product States (MPS), which is capable of simulating arbitrary bosonic tree-structured Hamiltonians. It implements the Optimized Boson Basis (OBB) and a variational shift to allow for almost arbitrary local bosonic Hilbert space dimensions, allowing to access the strong coupling regime.
The time-evolution is performed with the Time-Dependent Variational Principle (TDVP), based on the Dirac-Frenkel Principle.
